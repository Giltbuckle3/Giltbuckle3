I currently have a 3.14 GPA. 

[Here](https://github.com/cpwebs/ds202_finalproject) is a link to my favorite project I worked on. It was a final project for DS 202 and it was focused on finding out factors in each state that would increase or decrease the number of accidents that would occur in each state depending on time of day, time of year, precipitation, etc...
